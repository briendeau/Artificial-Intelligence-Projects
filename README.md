# Artificial-Intelligence-Projects
Applying AI Learning Techniques in various projects to gain practical experience


## Machine learning and deep learning are both types of AI.
In short, machine learning is AI that can automatically adapt with minimal human interference. 
Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks to mimic the learning process of the human brain.

## Techniques used in Machine Learning and Deep learning 

» Statistical analysis
» Neural networks
» Decision trees
» Evolutionary algorithms

## TensorFlow is an open-source, multi-machine set of APIs (application programming interfaces) used for building, learning, and doing research on deep learning. 
It hides a lot of the complexity of deep learning, which makes the technology more 
accessible
